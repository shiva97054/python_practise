TUPLES


Not every data stored in file. sometimes data must be ordered in "sequence " to be useful.


*) List are most comman tool, but there is a smaller, faster alternative : The tuple 



Difference b/w list & tuples :

list : 1) Add data ,2) Remove data, 3) change data. 

Tuples : !) can't change the data , 2) "Immutable" 3) Made quickly


Note : Less memory can be capable as compare to list.





# List example

prime _number = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 , 17]

# Tuple example
perfect_squares = (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36)

# Display lengths

print("#  primes = ", len(prime_numbers))
print(", len(perfect_squares"))



o/p : #primes =7
      #sequences =6
